# Super Star Trek game (Java implementation)

Java port of the classic Super Star Trek game originally written in BASIC in the 1970s. This implementation is part of [the challenge posted by Jeff Atwood in Dec 2021](https://blog.codinghorror.com/updating-the-single-most-influential-book-of-the-basic-era/).

[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU3NKOnRNCI&t=172s&ab_channel=TacianoDreckmannPerez) for the detailed 'making of' the game.

In order to play, build it and run the main game class: `com.github.tacianoperez.superstartrek.SuperStarTrekGame`.
